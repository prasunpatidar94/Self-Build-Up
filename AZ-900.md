	.Types Of clouds:
              Public Cloud: (anyone can use)
                     The public cloud is the defined as computering services offered by third-party provices over the 
                     public internate , making them available to anyone how wants to use and purchase them.
                     Azure owns the hardware on their networks and infrastructure 
                     
             Private cloud : (only for puticular man or Orgenozation)
                     it is as computing services offred either over the internate or a private network internal 
                     network and only to select users instead of the general public.
                     it is looks like a cloud . except customer owns or leases or has exclusive access to the hardware.
                     it is calles azure stack  so you can purchase it .
             Hybrid Cloud: (something public and something private)
                     It is the computing enviroment that is comnination of the private and public cloud.
                     it will able to provider some of the feature are private and some of the feature are public uses.
                     in this infrasture is private but the may bhi services are the public.
